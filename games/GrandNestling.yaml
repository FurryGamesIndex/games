  ##Side Note: the First Page Of An Old Diary

  Time passed fast. Since when I started to enjoy keeping a diary?It has been a whole year ever since I knew them. I have made a lot of new friends, and I also reconnected with some old friends as well.
  But most importantly, I met him…
  Well, the point of this diary was to document all my life events in the last year. Since I’m becoming more and more forgetful, I have to write everything down before they all get lost in my messy mind.
  The stuff that I am about to keep in this diary are all secrets which I would lock inside a safe, and the safe could never be opened by anyone else except me. But if I passed away at some point, this diary would bring those back to light again.
  Suppose it happens… If others find out the tough guy in their mind actually has such a flabby aspect, then I’d rather jump off a building.
  So, whoever opens this diary, I just want you to read it as a tasteless story, and you shall never share it to anyone else! Otherwise, all my reputation and dignity would be diminished.
  Anyway, that’s all I have to say. Let the story begin on May 1st of last year…
