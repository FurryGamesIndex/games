description: |
  You're having the time of your life in Rome on a study abroad program when you're suddenly abducted by an alien. What does he want from you? Well, he doesn't seem to want to tell and, before you know it, you're millions of miles away from Earth on your way to a place you know nothing about.

  Adastra is a romance visual novel with a whole bunch of sci-fi and political intrigue mixed in. You'll experience the perils of navigating an empire in turmoil while deciding who you should and who you definitely shouldn't trust.

  In this climate of turncoats and backstabbers, you start to wonder if the alien that abducted you is the one person you can trust the most.
