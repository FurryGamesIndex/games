description: |
  Distant Travels is a sci-fi visual novel focused on the theme of Quantum Entanglement, and the question - can feelings be entangled?

  With scars of the past, and recurring dreams that seem as they're about someone you know. And the looming threat of the Endless White consuming the world..

  But wait. You're just you. A network tech working a job with little prospects of moving on... Until, there's a job opportunity.

  Will this job lead you to a better life or just lead you to feel the same failure you once felt?
