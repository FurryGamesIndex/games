  A Pokémon dungeon crawler/roguelike spinoff in which the player wakes up as human-turned-Pokémon with amnesia. It is an enhanced version of Pokémon Mystery  Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorer of Darkness. It is based off the [Mystery Dungeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Dungeon) series. The player engages in turn-based combat versus other hostile Pokémon while exploring Mystery Dungeons. They start off with a partner Pokémon that is chosen in the beginning of the game as their teammate, but they can add more members later, with a max of four Pokémon on a team.
