  Omensight is an Action Murder Mystery game and a spiritual successor to the award-winning Stories: The Path of Destinies.

  You are the Harbinger, a mythical warrior who only appears in times of crisis. The land of Urralia is torn by war, and as night falls, you witness its destruction at the hands of a dark God. As the eyes and the sword of Urralia, it is up to you to reverse this fate. All you know is that it started with a mysterious murder.
