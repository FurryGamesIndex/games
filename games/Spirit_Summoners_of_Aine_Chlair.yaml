  Daigo "Damian" Minazuki (水無月 大悟 Minazuki Daigo) is a 23-year-old wolf who is cheerful, optimistic, and simple to the point of being ditzy—this, however, conceals his tragic past. After leaving his hometown, Rougetsu Village, Damian came to Asou City, working as a wage earner in Happy Street Mall. He hopes that he might spend his entire life surrounded by smiles and laughter, but wouldn't care if people didn't miss him if he was gone. However, as rumors start to spread of people in Asou City starting to go missing one after another,  Damian encounters a kobold-like creature. From that moment on, his life would never be the same again...
