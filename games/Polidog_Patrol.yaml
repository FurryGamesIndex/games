name: Polidog Patrol / ポリドッグパトロール

description: |
  The latest work from the team *Untendo* that created the [Benki Wars](BENKI_WARS.html).
  It is a full-fledged action game that was completed after two and a half years of development.

  # Game Description
  The game is a side-view action RPG in which you control a rookie cop, Shibakuro, and solve a variety of cases. Battles take place seamlessly as you explore a vast field and fight against an evil organization with senior police officers.

  # Play time
  About 20 hours (varies depending on the style of play)

  # Trial Version
  As this game is very heavy, we have attached a load test version of the game in the trial version section. It is possible to actually operate the game, so it can also function as a trial version. Please use it before purchasing.
