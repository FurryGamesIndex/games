  NOTE: This game has been canceled and released as-is, no further updates will be made.

  Play as Vergence as he must combat waves of feisty enemies, all hampering to get a piece of his tail. We kept the three button formula while sprinkling in some added depth:

  * Walk into enemies to grab them, each direction offering a unique move.
  * Try different button combinations for extra attacks
  * Perform Verges special attack to devastate enemies while sacrificing health
  * Encounter multiple unique weapons and power-ups
  * Put your dexterity to the test by mastering our sex minigame!
  * Optional SFW mode for Let's Players or those who want a traditional game experience!
