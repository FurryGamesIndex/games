  Paws is a tale of two halves and sees you traverse a vast and harrowing landscape while fending off the threats that hunt you as you make your way home. Journey through the expanded world of Shelter 2 in the standalone adventure!

  *Dark and grime, twist through the vines,*  
  *Slip through perils with finesse and toil.*  
  *Be two for strength, be two of mind,*  
  *Find the way home to familiar soil.*
