brief-description: |
  UNDERTALE! The RPG game where you don't have to destroy anyone.

description: |
  Welcome to UNDERTALE. In this RPG, you control a human who falls underground into the world of monsters. Now you must find your way out... or stay trapped forever.

  (Healthy Dog's Warning: Game contains imagery that may be harmful to players with photosensitive epilepsy or similar condition.)

  ##Features:
  
  - Killing is unnecessary: negotiate out of danger using the unique battle system.
  - Time your attacks for extra damage, then dodge enemy attacks in a style reminiscent of top-down shooters.
  - Original art and soundtrack brimming with personality.   
  - Soulful, character-rich story with an emphasis on humor.
  - Created mostly by one person.
  - Become friends with all of the bosses!
  - At least 5 dogs.
  - You can date a skeleton.
  - Hmmm... now there are 6 dogs...?
  - Maybe you won't want to date the skeleton.
  - I thought I found a 7th dog, but it was actually just the 3rd dog.
  - If you play this game, can you count the dogs for me...? I'm not good at it.
