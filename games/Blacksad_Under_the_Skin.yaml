  A dark corruption scandal in the heart of the New York City's underworld for charismatic detective John Blacksad!

  The 50s, New York City: Joe Dunn, owner of a boxing club, is found dead.

  Meanwhile, rising star Bobby Yale, due to take to the ring for the most important fight of his career, has mysteriously disappeared.

  Sonia Dunn, Joe’s daughter, takes over the gym and must deal with its financial woes. She hires private detective John Blacksad to investigate Yale’s disappearance. This sinister case will take our investigator to the darkest, most dismal depths of New York.
