  ##THE STORY
  
  In Witanlore: Dreamtime, you assume the role of a young Ursine brave whose destiny has not yet been determined. Guided by a spirit totem animal, you embark on an astral journey into the spirit world to stand before your patron deity and receive divine messages about your destiny. However, there is something far less benevolent than a goddess waiting for you in the mists...
  
  Find yourself swept up in the chaos of an ancient battle for power, the outcome of which hinges on your decisions and a weapon that could lead us all to salvation or ruin. The path you take and the choices you make will determine the story’s outcome and alter the very fabric of the world.
  
  Witanlore: Dreamtime is a single player, story-driven, Adventure RPG for Windows PC, being developed on Unreal Engine 4.
