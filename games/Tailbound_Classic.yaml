  Tailbound: Classic is currently the only public build available. **It is not representative of the final game in any way, as it is nearly 2 years old, and is only a relic of the early design/plot I had laid out.** I have a full [walkthrough of the game written here,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RG8ZWW2Nm8G8wv3Cy5TjD-kw_wL6niLGVF96ypauekM/edit?usp=sharing) which is helpful considering how cryptic some of the puzzles are. This version of the game is currently free, however I might unlist it once the game is finished to avoid future confusion
