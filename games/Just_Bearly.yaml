  A comedic story game played in vignettes, about feeling anxious as a bear in inner city Melbourne, Australia, and trying to connect to people none the less. 

  Click, pull, mash, and guide your way through an ever changing mix of dialogue choices, reaction challenges, dexterity tests, rhythm games and God only knows what else as you overthink and under-perform your way through every day life -- Striving towards greatness and being less of an awkward, anxious, crap.

  ##Key features:

  - Vignette story telling
  - Very realistic simulations of awkward situations
  - Interactive panic attacks
  - Laugh-y bits
  - Cry-y bits
  - pretty ok original photography
