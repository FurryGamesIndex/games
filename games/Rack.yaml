  Rack is a science-themed bondage game where you can perform sexual tests and experiments using a variety of toys and gadgets. As you play the game, you'll unlock new features, lab settings, and test subjects to play with.

  The game features a massive variety of test subjects of all genders and species, including human characters. It also supports custom character importing, which means there are lots of user-created characters available.

  You can get your own character added to the game by keeping an eye on my [FurAffinity account](http://www.furaffinity.net/user/fek), where I occasionally hold character auctions. If you're artistically inclined and have access to Flash Pro CS6 or higher, you can also make your own character using the [template files](http://www.fek.onl/racksubjects/templates.html), which are available to the public completely free-of-charge.
