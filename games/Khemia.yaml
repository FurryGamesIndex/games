  Things have changed quite a bit on Adastra. The Human's arrival has altered the political course of the entire galaxy. After his departure, the friends he knew on the wolven moon are left guessing as to what needs to be done next. The Parents, the supposedly all-knowing, all-powerful beings controlling the Galaxias, have a plan, but it's not like they're being upfront about it. They never are, and Scipio, a young wolf on a diplomatic mission, starts to wonder if these Parents really do hold all the answers. He starts to wonder if there are Others.
