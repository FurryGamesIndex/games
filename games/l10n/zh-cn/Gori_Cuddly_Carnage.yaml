  Come meet the team. First up, there’s your sentient, razor-sharp hoverboard, *F.R.A.N.K.* Then there’s *CH1-P*, a modular AI that will constantly complain as you wipe out hordes of corrupted cuddly toys. And then there’s the star of the show – *Gori* – the most adorable and badass cat in the world.  

    

  This cuddly crew gets unwillingly dragged into a battle that wiped out all humans and laid waste to everything on earth that wasn’t cute and cuddly enough for The Adorable Army - a horde of mutated and blood-thirsty toys that only YOU can destroy!
