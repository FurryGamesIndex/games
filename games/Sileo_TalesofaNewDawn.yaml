  Sileo: Tales of a New Dawn is a gay furry visual novel currently in development. Escape your old life and start anew in the idyllic mountain town of Woodcrest. Reunite with an old flame, make new friends, begin a new career and perhaps even find love? Play through multiple unique novel-length storylines in which you'll overcome great obstacles, meet a litany of colorful characters and perhaps even fall in love with the man of your dreams!  

  Sileo originally began development in April 2020 and our first public release took place in June 2020. Since then, we've been releasing new builds with tons of additional content each and every month, and will continue to do so until the game is complete. Be sure to check back often to see what new content we have in store for you!

  If you like what you see, be sure to [**support us on Patreon**](http://patreon.com/werecat) to get monthly development builds, behind the scenes updates, hi-resolution artwork and more! We'd really appreciate your support!

  We will release new builds of Sileo each month. Patreon will receive new content one month ahead of the Itch builds, however bug fixes and other improvements will be identical between versions where applicable.
