name: Tooth and Tail

description: |
  Lead the revolution with an army of flamethrowing Boars, mustard gas-lobbing Skunks, and paratrooper-puking Owls.  Tooth and Tail is a Real-Time-Strategy game featuring Single Player, Online Competitive Play, Split Screen, Replays, and more.
  
  Build a base, lead your army, eat your enemies!
  
  ##The War for Meat

  The Longcoats, the Commonfolk, the KSR, and the Civilized are in the midst of a Civil War over who gets to eat, and who has to be the meat.  A darkly humorous tale of riots and revolution is told through an extensive Single Player campaign.
  
  ##Endless Replayability

  With procedurally generated maps and customizable factions, no two conflicts will be the same, forcing players to strategize rather than memorize.
  
  ##Pick-up-and-Play

  With matches lasting from 5-12 minutes, controls designed specifically for the gamepad, and split-screen couch play, Tooth and Tail is a popcorn RTS for veterans and newcomers alike.
