  The plot and story focuses around Eliot, a human from our world and his story after he mysteriously wakes up in a foreign world where his only lifeline is a werewolf-like person that is willing to help Eliot find a way to the nearest safe place, however the road there is a long one and their vastly different lives will make living and understanding each other a difficult challenge to face while traveling.

  I want this story to focus on the characters, their wants and needs, the way they view things and their ability to communicate with each other to make this new uncomfortable lifestyle bearable as they gradually learn how to live together.

  ### What Have you planned for this project?

  For the technical side, I plan for this project to be something as high quality as i can make it, with most character's expression and poses being unique and non-reusable, with some of said expressions and some elements that'd id want to animate, if possible, with a good soundtrack that I'll commission from multiple artists i want to support!
  
  Ideally, I'd want this project to have a visual rhythm similar to storyboards.
  
  The story main points have already been written down and it will be divided into 3 tomes/books that'll each have 5 chapters.
  
  When it comes to length, the demo will be around 8 to 10 minutes, and ideally each chapter would last around 90 to 120 minutes, and while im aware that it's prob not much compared to the standards of other visual novels, the goal is to have a polished, very detailed and visual experience that needs much more artwork than most visual novel projects, so with the amount of work being increased per scene, it's normal that the overall length of the experience is shortened to lessen the overall workload.
  
  The project will not be updated bit by bit publicly, and public releases will only occur when a full chapter is finished.

  The 8-10 min demo is AVAILABLE

  And last, if you wish to support this project and help me out financially, here's my patreon page where ya can get various rewards ranging from having your name be shown in the chapter's end credits to having access to scripts and story boards, and more!
