  You accepted a request to change your soul with other beastmen in different dimention. You are having a short trip going to the other world where beastmen live with becoming beastman. You can go through different routes for each beastmen: a total of three of them. The route you play is determined by favorability system, influenced by your choices through the game.

  You could get extra CG (including NSFW) for each route if you get a good relationship with that route's beastman.

  We expect the playtime of this complete game will be 6 hours. Also, this is a remake of the original novel that was serialized in Korea's furry fandom by the story writer. So we are confident to make this game completely.

  ##For English Users:
  
  English translation: Sorry for the poor English in game. There were lack of time since our team is all constructed with university students. (And also lack of English influent member, hm... I guess I should post a job opening in Korea fandom.)
  
  Also, we already have a complete script for the old prototype version of this game, so we guarantee that we could complete this game.
