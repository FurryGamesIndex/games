  ## WHAT IS "AFTER CLASS"?
  After Class is a gay, mainly NSFW story driven furry visual novel focused on the relationship between the main character (you / default name: Walter) and the people he meets. This VN covers some controversial topics, your everyday conversation, dead memes, and such. Every choice you make has its consequences, and it might change the outcome of the story.

  ## THE STORY
  You play as Walter, a clumsy husky/malamute/wolf mix beastman, who has yearned for a change since the high school times. After thousands of reasoning and arguments, you managed to convince your parents to let you move out.

  Finally free from a house that you described as a prison in all but name, you started moving to your new house, where your parents rented for you.

  Even though they let you move out, they had one rule you should follow: "Move to Highwell and attend Highwell University." which you agreed gleefully.

  It's the first day of college, and you know no one in this city. You met a bunch of new people! Some of them are weird, some of them are nice, some had a troubled past. But one thing for sure: they are being too friendly with you as if you were a friend they used to know...?

  As you get to know them better, your head started to hurt more often, forgotten memories resurfacing, and cryptic dreams keep appearing in your sleep. They are almost like a part of something really important... Everything seems to be just ordinary, but then strange things keep happening...

  What is it, and why can't you remember anything about it?

  Did your parents send you here, knowing that you'll remember everything? Or is it a mere coincidence?
