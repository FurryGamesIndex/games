  Come meet the team. First up, there’s your sentient, razor-sharp hoverboard, *F.R.A.N.K.* Then there’s *CH1-P*, a modular AI that will constantly complain as you wipe out hordes of corrupted cuddly toys. And then there’s the star of the show – *Gori* – the most adorable and badass cat in the world.  
    
  This cuddly crew gets unwillingly dragged into a battle that wiped out all humans and laid waste to everything on earth that wasn’t cute and cuddly enough for The Adorable Army - a horde of mutated and blood-thirsty toys that only YOU can destroy!

  * Fast-paced, third-person skate-and-slash carnage.  
  * A futuristic world tainted by the Adorable Army.  
  * Immersive (and very cute) environments.  
  * Adaptable music that reacts to your actions and playstyle.  
  * Intense destruction, brutal combat, and a whole world to smash to bits.
    
  Follow Gori, F.R.A.N.K., and CH1-P, on their journey to save their own lives and stop the carnage of the Adorable Army and its dark leaders.
