name: Ever a Promise / 彼时的约定

  "Time doesn't stop flowing.
  Youth like a forest.
  We search but also wait.
  Only to meet that one."

  At the end of the junior, the summer vacation is coming.
  The main character, Yiwu student, met many people.
  The cogs of fate are turning in corners we can't see.
  The thoughts that died three years ago ...... is again drumming.
  With the passage of time, it leaves scars in the heart without trace.

  Life is long, but youth is short. I think this is the end of my green years.

  (Translated from Chinese)
