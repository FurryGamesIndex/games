  ## What is Lustful Desires?

  It’s an adult text-based game with rpg mechanics, inspired by titles like “Flexible Survival” or “Trials in Tainted Space".

  ## Can you tell me something about the world?

  It’s a typical fantasy world where people lives in a small towns trying to survive in a dangerous surroundings. The wilderness is full of beasts and unfortunately not all of them are friendly, not to mention it’s very easy to get lost in thick forests or vast swamps. Some even mentioning ancient ruins scattered all around the land, but not many were able to learn about the past. It’s easier to stick to one safe place, instead of travelling, but yet it still not stopping people from exploring.

  Lately the situation started to change. The urges and desires rises everywhere making living creatures wanting something more than only food and a place to rest.

  ## How does the game looks?

  Like in all text-based game everything here is described with words. A lot of words.

  The graphic is only a helping touch. At this point everything in this area is a Work In Progress – background, interface. In the future I hope I will be able to add graphics of creatures and beasts you can encounter.

  ## What do I have to do?

  During your adventure you are going to meet a lot of people and you will face many different situations. Have in mind that the way you deal with the problem may have consequences later. Do you want to be a hero everyone respect or maybe you prefer to give all the pleasure to everyone interested?

  During the talks you will have the options to pick the way you want your character to behave. This may look similar to narrative in a visual novels and like in those some scenes gonna look different depend on what route you took.

  There is also a simple battle system. You gonna meet the same opponents very often and their behavior will change depend on how you acted earlier. The bandit will look at you differently if you decide to submit to him, instead of fighting.

  Also as an herbalist you will learn a lot about making potions which will help you during your journeys. Prepare yourself for a lot of trips to find resources needed for crafting, but be careful because they can end in an unexpected ways.

  ## How about some kind of summary?

    - Narrative system: Your choices often have consequences. People like to talk so think how you want to be seen in towns.
    - Quest system: Talk with NPCs, some of them may have an additional job for you.
    - Day/Night Cycle: Maybe you should check some places later?
    - Battle system: Fight or Tease? It all depends on what you want.
    - Statuses: Pay attention, some of the attacks may leave you with additional effects. If you won’t sleep or you drink too much it will have affect on you as well.
    - Opponents: Each group of opponents has their own attitude. Defeat a lot of them and they will be angry, submit to them and they will look at you with gracious eye.
    - Crafting system: Learn new recipes, collect resources, makes a wide variety of potions.
    - Equipment system: Take your favorite weapon and armor with you.
    - Variety: This world is inhabited not only by humans. Expect to find other species, different beasts and animals. If you are looking for naughty times, you will find scenes between all the genders.
    - Themes: M/M, M/F, F/F, fantasy creature (lizardman, werewolf, etc)

  ## What are you planning to add?

    - More content obviously. More areas, more enemies, more quests, more scenes.
    - Better quest system.
    - Improving the look of the interface.
    - Graphics for NPCs and creatures you may encounter.
