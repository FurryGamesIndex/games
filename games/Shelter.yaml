  Awoo, traveler! Welcome to Shelter!

  It's a furry visual novel about a bunch of those medieval fantasy dogs and a human who made their home at a mysterious, gigantic metal structure filled with futuristic technology in the middle of fantasy Siberia.
  The game takes place during the preparations for their version of fireworks night, by using a life-force fueled turret of mass destruction. I swear it makes sense in context!

  It's nsfw and I think it'll satisfy dog-lovers. eyebrow wiggles
