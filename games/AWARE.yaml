  ## Plot Summary
  A young man, driven by necessity to take up a part-time job as a courier, finds himself tempted by the promise of a substantial reward to deliver a mysterious package that "cannot find its address." Unexpectedly, after glimpsing that the package's contents include a 'body', he's thrust into a conflict among various powers. Should he trust the strong, silent lone wolf who is the intended recipient of the package; align with the organization he has long admired; or heed the call of a mysterious criminal? The choice is his to make.
