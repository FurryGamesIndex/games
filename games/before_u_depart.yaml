description: |
  Canines are often companions for life. Some can even be companions in death...

  This is a SFW visual novel, but player discretion is advised. Our story deals with heavy topics such as:

  Terminal Illness
  Mental Health
  Death & Grief

  This project was made for the May Wolf Visual Novel Game Jam. Please go check out the submission made by the other developers!

  This visual novel is a 100% complete experience. Any updates made in the future will be for bug fixes, quality-of-life improvements, or implementing features we didn't have time to create.
