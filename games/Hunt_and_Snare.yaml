  Hunt and Snare is a Furry Third Person Shooter with a strong focus on sexual themes and character interaction. Travel between islands on a ship with your trusted ship crew, hunt rare species with a tranquilizer rifle or capture with bare paws,and sell to the highest bidder after rigorous sampling of the prey. Will your crew grow to love you as an equal ship commander, or will they idolize you as a renowned hunter?
  
  Hunt for rare and unique species of all genders and races: Using your trusty tranquilizer long rifle, or go feral and capture with your bare paws!
  
  Fully customize your character: Select from general body shape, including species, breasts, genitalia, and tail, down to the color and pattern of your skin and pupil style.
  
  Opinion based conversation system: Gain favors by interacting with other characters frequently. Be loved, be hated, be admired, or be feared!
  
  Sexplore a juicy selection of fetishes and gender combinations: From M/F, M/M, F/F, Futa/M, Futa/F, to Futa/Futa all covered with Classic, Anal, Blowjob, Pawjob, Pawing, Submissive/Domination, Toys, Solo, and Milking (your ship needs natural fuel, doesn’t it?).
  
  Fully filterable acts and prey: Customize your selection by enabling or disabling any type of act in the game as well as disabling specific types of prey.
  
  Fully animated: Hundreds of animations, with motion captured movement, "physics-based dynamic bones" in breasts, penises, ears, and tails, and animated lips, vagina, and anus. 
  
  Showroom: Select from a large selection of various positions you have discovered or play out full acts in various locations and environments.

  # About us
  Ruffleneck - Programming / Art / Design - [FA](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/ruffleneck/)/[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ruffleneck) - That's me! I have 9 years of professional experience as artist, designer, and gameplay programmer. Late 2016 I started working on the Hunt and Snare prototype and hanging around in the adult game developer community. Oh boy! I enjoy it a lot more than the "normal" game developer community. Hunt and Snare is my little baby dragon and I hope you enjoy it too! <3
  
  Hareress - Animation / Skin Designer / Map Builder - [FA](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/hareress)/[Twitter](https://twitter.com/hareress) - Hareress is a 2D artist, also my little bunny and my owner, who is sharing the content workload with me. Their primary focus is on animations, skin designing, and map building.
  
  Drathek - Programming - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Drathek) - Drathek is a blazingly awesome red and black dragon who does a fantastic job easing my burdens by handling majority of the programming tasks. Drathek is effectively the lead programmer of Hunt and Snare, or senior, or greater dragon programmer, not sure what describes their role the best :3
  
  Nullbunny - Programming - [FA](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/nullbunny/) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nullbunny) - Nullbunny is a brilliant and fun bunny who joined us as the second programmer, both helping Drathek, and helping us, together, to realize my wildest dreams for Hunt and Snare, and help bring features in faster :3
