  Humans are long gone. Will your lumberpunk beavers do any better? A city-building game featuring ingenious animals, vertical architecture, river control, and deadly droughts. Contains high amounts of wood.

  Mankind turned Earth into a dry wasteland and perished, but some species adapted and evolved. Choose one of the unique beaver factions and see how long your colony can last!

  ## Wet and dry seasons

  Prepare your settlement for recurring droughts. Stockpile on food and keep fields and forests alive even after rivers dry up. Rely on both natural water sources and artificial irrigation to keep the land arable.

  ## River control

  Redirect rivers, put up dams and dig water canals with explosives – beavers of the future have millennia of experience in water engineering. But be careful, uncontrolled flooding is as deadly as a dynamite blast!

  ## Lumberpunk

  Turn timber into sophisticated machinery, buildings, and monuments. Wood is the core resource in Timberborn, but the most advanced structures require metal. To find it, send your scavengers to the ruins of the old world.

  ## Vertical architecture

  Create a thriving beaver settlement using a modular, vertical architecture system. Space is limited, so stack lodges and workshops on top of each other, cover hills with fields, and set up a power grid for your growing population.

  ## Day and night cycle

  Build a prosperous city with efficient production chains and beaverish nighttime activities. Follow the lives of individually simulated inhabitants throughout their day and celebrate when the next generation is born!

  ## Wellbeing

  Satisfy the needs of your colonists to extend their lifespan and make them happier. An evolved beaver's lifestyle is not just "work, sleep and chomp on wood". Balanced diet, decorations, temples, even carousels – you take care of it all.

  ## Beaver societies

  Control different beaver factions, each with unique style, buildings, and gameplay traits. While some beavers are expert farmers, another family might rely on rapid industrialization. Choose what fits your playstyle!

  ## Map editor

  Play on one of the included maps or create your own and share it with the community! With hills of different height, ruins scattered in the desert, and all life depending on access to water, each map poses a different challenge.

  ## ...and more!

  We regularly add new features and iterate, based on the community's feedback. We’re making the world’s first beaver city-builder and we want to make it special, so stay in the loop and add Timberborn to your wishlist today!
