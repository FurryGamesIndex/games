  Humans are long gone. Will your lumberpunk beavers do any better? A city-building game featuring ingenious animals, vertical architecture, river control, and deadly droughts. Contains high amounts of wood.

  Mankind turned Earth into a dry wasteland and perished, but some species adapted and evolved. Pick one of the beaver factions and see how long your colony can last.

  ## Beaver societies

  Control one of two beaver factions: the nature-friendly Folktails or the industrious Iron Teeth. Each faction has a unique style, buildings, and gameplay traits. Choose what fits your playstyle!

  ## Wet and dry seasons

  Prepare your settlement for recurring droughts. Stockpile on food and keep fields and forests alive even after rivers dry up. Rely on both natural water sources and artificial irrigation to keep the land arable.

  ## River control

  Beavers of the future have millennia of experience in water engineering. Put up dams and floodgates, dig canals with explosives, and redirect rivers to bring life back to the wasteland. Just be careful with that dynamite.

  ## Lumberpunk

  Turn timber into sophisticated machinery – from water wheels and sawmills to engines and shredders. Wood is the core resource in Timberborn, but the most advanced structures require metal. To find it, send your scavengers to the ruins of the old world.

  ## Vertical architecture

  Create a thriving beaver settlement using a vertical architecture system. Space is limited, so stack lodges and workshops on top of each other, construct platforms and bridges, and set up a power grid for your growing population.

  ## Day and night cycle

  ![](https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/Timberborn-6-DayNight.gif)

  Build a multi-district city with efficient production chains and nighttime activities. Follow the lives of individually simulated inhabitants throughout their day and celebrate when the next generation is born!

  ## Wellbeing

  An evolved beaver's lifestyle is not just "work, sleep and chomp on wood". Satisfy the needs of your rodents with a balanced diet, decorations, monuments, and more – on top of keeping the colony alive.

  ## Map editor

  Play on one of the included maps or create your own and share it with the community! With hills of different heights, ruins scattered in the desert, and all life depending on access to water, each map poses a different challenge.

  ## ...and more!

  We regularly add new features and iterate, based on the community's feedback. We’re making the world’s first beaver city-builder and we want to make it special, so stay in the loop and add Timberborn to your wishlist today!
