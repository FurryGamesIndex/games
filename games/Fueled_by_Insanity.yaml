name: Fueled by Insanity

description: |
  Fueled by Insanity is a horror visual novel in which you play as Jeffrey, an anxiety-ridden yet cheerful fox as you encounter a new friend named Ted. The two, seeming to be in a similar life situation, decide to stick together to help each other out.

  After going back to your hometown, you will encounter old friends and family along the way, and who knows what adventures may await when you return.

  All character sprites and cg art is done by my friend, Coza. If you like his art, check out his page [Here](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/xcoza/)!
