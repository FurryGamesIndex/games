  Kemo Coliseum is an adult puzzle RPG game. Players will take a role of Volga, an ex-soldier from the Nuana, the country of the North, and participate in the tournament in the Kingdom of Kornelia. The winner of the tournament will be rewarded with a title of a "Gladiator", and a chance ask one wish to be granted by the king of Kornelia.

  The game is a mix of a match-3 puzzle game with RPG elements. Matching three or more gems of the same type to erase them from the board. Each gem type will result in different action, ranging from a physical attack to charging your skills. Fans of PuzzleQuest will get a hang of the game very quickly, but even if you have never played PuzzleQuest before, the game is very easy to learn. 

  While the goal of the game is to win the tournament, there are many things for you to do before you continue to the next round. Helping people in the town by completing quests, finding rare items and improve your skill by exploring the dungeons, or build relationship with other contestants.
