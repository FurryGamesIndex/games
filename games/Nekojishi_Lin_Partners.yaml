  Three years after the story of Nekojishi, Liao is out of college and strapped for cash and those closest to him, the spirits Lin Hu, Likulau, and Yan Shu-Chi are desperate to help Liao get a job. 

  Take the reins at Lin & Partners Architects LLP, an architecture firm specialising in the restoration of haunted locations, and solving the problems of the beast-man spirits dwelling within them.

  As Lin & Partners grows, a larger company looms near. Liao and the others must uncover their motives and ideals for tradition in modern society.

  ## Debate Battles

  When the time comes for Liao to convince a spirit, a debate begins! Debates are real-time RPG battles where the player uses Argument Cards to damage their opponent's credibility (HP). Using cards makes use of Inspiration Points (IP) which are replenished every turn.

  In some scenarios, you may even need to use specific clues gathered in the adventure to disprove statements made by your opponent! Choose correctly and you'll leave them wide open!

  Make smart use of Argument Cards and their effects to show your opponents your way of thinking! The cards you have access to will change depending on your progress in the adventure, what characters are by your side, side quests completed, and other secrets hidden in the world.
