brief-description: |
  Become an experiment and flee with friends from this chaotic and amazing place. And as the exploration deepens, the truth gradually emerges...

  This game contains the Furry element (only exists in the character), but this is only my personal preference. And all elements contained in this game are all my personal preference.

  ##Please explain the overview of the game!
  The Lar is a story-playing game made with Rpg Maker and includes several branch routes and endings, a bit puzzles. You will explore this unknown and amazing place in the game flow of about 3 hours, and work with a variety of experimental bodies to find a way to leave.
  Music is not original, please read "Ream me" in the game directory.

  ##So what should i do?
  Explore, investigate, see new "Experimenter", get their trust, or become friends, and eventually escape from here. The route will be changed by your choice, paying attention to everything that needs attention, otherwise you may be on the wrong route.
  You can try to unravel the puzzles in some of the scenes and trigger more rich storylines.
  Relax and experience the story of Lar and his friends.

  ##What else do i need to know?
  There is only one game developer.
  Thanks for Charem to translation!
