  This is the PackedRat "hub" as it were. Each update will still have their own post. Otherwise, this game's stable branch updates nearly monthly. The nightly branch updates nearly every few days to a week or so. Both update with an image uploaded announcing it. The nightly is the most up to date with mostly small incremental changes; New rooms, enemy changes, and bug fixes. However features are experimental and may not even work properly or look right. Bug reports are welcome. Asking me how to get through the game isn't so much. I'm happy to give hints, but not 15 different questions of "What do I do now." Stable is recommended if you need an offline version, have lag issues, or are on a metered connection and don't want to deal with my rather fast updates flooding it.
