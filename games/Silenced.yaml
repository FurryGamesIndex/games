  ## About the Silenced:


  The whole world is gradually coming to an end, and no one can be saved.  
  Only by slaying the terrifying monster that destroyed the White Wolf Kingdom, the "Beast",  
  everything could finally get better.  

  You wake up on the road to the capital city, and you have no choice.  
  Cross forests, valleys, and long rivers to reach the imperial capital,  
  annihilate countless enemies, and start the legend of yourself.  

  But you are just an ordinary person, no fancy skills,  
  no equipment to enhance your abilities.  
  You only have a small machete, your own mind, and your friends.  

  Do remember, you are not a hero who should have come here.  
  Maybe you shouldn't have to bear the rise and fall of the whole world.  
  One ordinary person's ability is ultimately limited.
