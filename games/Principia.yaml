brief-description: |
  An insurmountable barrier... It was a moment of realisation that it looms everywhere...

  PRINCIPIA is a Visual novel game featuring anthro races called BeastChild.

  Main characters:
  Nicolas :  A low-paid kombinat worker. Often smokes  cigars.

  Alfred :  An honored student of Nordburg University .

  Hal:  A pious believer, and sister of the Church .

  Thales:  A youth with intellectual disability, working at the same factory with Nicolas.

  Feature:

  Oddly as a novel with furry characters, the story begins with Nicolas smoking a cigar and complaining about his company. Then Hal notes on his behavior based on her religious belief.

  The subject of this game is Nicolas's romantic feeling for Hal, and the gap between reality and the ideal world referred to as "The world of harmony" by Hal.

  Staffs:
