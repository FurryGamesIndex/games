  The story of the great Knight of the Upperfield! The bravest! The most handsome! The&hellip; yeah no.
  
  The Hayseed Knight is a plot driven fantasy comedy visual novel created by a single person (yo!) that follows the adventures of Ader, the one eyed deer, while he desperately tries to stay on track to fulfill his dream: becoming a knight!
  
  But he's a peasant... and pretty damn poor at that! That's not going to stop him, is it?
  ...WELL, it kinda is. Dreams aren't edible after all.
  
  On a meta sense, the player is The Narrator, a character hellbent on finding out what truly happened to Ader and his friends, who are little more than legendary characters at this point.
  
  - Fully and lovingly voice acted!
  - Gorgeous, animated sprites!
  - Meet adorable, unique characters!
  - A detailed encyclopedia for people who love worldbuilding!
  - Completely safe for work. Yes really. PG 13. Please, stop asking. Please.
  - COMPLETELY FREE. Like the wind.

  Content Warnings: fantasy racism, fantasy homophobia, sexual abuse threat

  Current Known Issues:

  - Save files NOT compatible with 1.4! (damn you encyclopaedia)
  - The encyclopaedia is STILL sorta ugly, but its functionality has been vastly improved since 1.4! At the cost of the save file compatibility as mentioned above.
  - The CG gallery has somehow turned even buggier and I don't even know how. Use at your own risk???
  - Audio levels may be a bit off occasionally.
  - No battle system yet. I THINK IT'S FUNNIER LIKE THIS AT THIS POINT, RIGHT? R-RIGHT?
