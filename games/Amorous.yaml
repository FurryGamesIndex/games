  Originally, we had Steam Trading Cards in this list too, but we were attended at the fact pure free games don't get that option.
  
  How can this be free? There must be a catch! No catch! No depleting in-game currency every time you attempt to date a character, no in-game shop prompting you to buy more parts for your character. It's all there for you to enjoy for free.

  This game has seen many years of spare-time development, and all of it wouldn't have been possible without the support of our loyal Patrons. A free release on Steam is our way of thanking them and making sure the game will always remain available for everyone to enjoy.
