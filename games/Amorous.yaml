  ##What makes Amorous special?

  Amorous is a furry dating simulator which aims to provide a high quality graphic novel experience for free. Shake up the formula with animated NPCs, sandbox environments, real choices and interactive mini-games to keep you engaged. Avoid the normal pitfalls of dating games with an incredibly varied roster. Ranging from foxes to felines, male to female and everything in-between.

  ##So what's in it for me?

  - 9 fully datable characters
  - Thousands of lines of dialogue with branching trees for replayability
  - Several mini-games and novelties
  - Fursona Maker / Character Creator with content for all gender, body-type and personality preferences.

  ##How can this be free? There must be a catch!

  No catch! No depleting in-game currency every time you attempt to date a character, no in-game shop prompting you to buy more parts for your character. It's all there for you to enjoy for free.

  This game has seen many years of spare-time development, and all of it wouldn't have been possible without the support of our loyal Patrons. A free release is our way of thanking them and making sure the game will always remain available for everyone to enjoy.
