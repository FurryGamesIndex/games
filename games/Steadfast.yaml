  **A short story...**
  
  ***Steady your heart, my friend.***

  *"The perfect life may not exist in this rotten world."*
  
  *"But does that mean we shouldn't try...?"*

  ##Author's Note:
  
  Steadfast is a short story by my dear friend Drakes and I. 
  
  What started as a small project, turned into a story that surpassed my expectations and then some.
  
  I've learned a lot during the course of this project, not just with development and writing, but also about perspective on things.
  
  With that said, as it is a short story I feel like it is best not to give much away before the start.
  
  In essence, it's a romantic story, set in a medieval setting.
  
  The world is not always as it seems, and how you view it is not necessarily how someone else sees it.
