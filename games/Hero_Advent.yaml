  Hero's Advent is a romance-fantasy visual novel set in another world. Suddenly pulled into a new dimension, you're transformed into a furry. Upon waking up, you met Alisa the rabbit, who told you this world was in grave danger and that only you could free the land from the Evil King's grasp.
  
  Your journey starts at a humble homestead in the middle of the forest. After staying for about two week in the new world, you slowly grew more accustomed to life in this strange world. Alas, as much as you wanted to stay, your time grew short. Max the Mercenary was called to assist you in your journey of becoming the prophesized Hero. Throughout your journey, you will meet others who can help you along the way.
  
  Develop your relationship with them. Train hard everyday. Uncover secrets that lies before you. The path ahead is yours to set. Will you free the land from its curse or become its new tyrant? You decide!
