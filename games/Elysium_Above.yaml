  ##About Wanyan World
  
  This is the Continent of Wanyan.
  Wanyan, an enfeoffment kingdom lasted for thousands of years, though having enjoyed a long time of peace, is now at the brink of division. Its authority as a suzerain is declining, and its vassals are fighting against each other. Thousands of war is crushing numerous states and killing countless people.
  
  Lu, a traditional military state, has developed into a first-tier power by annexing surrounding states.

  The newly born Seven State Alliance under State Hong's leading is at the confrontation against Lu. Meanwhile, it is appealing to more states to join it.

  Between the two superpowers, there is the main stage of our story - Bo.
  Bo was crushed by Lu's sudden attack eleven years ago. Facing the irretrievable fate, King Kui chose to be a martyr for the fallen state, and the older prince Huang Zhu escaped to Hong in the south with the third prince. Since then, Bo's land is under the control of Lu.

  Eleven years later, to restore the state, Huang Zhu led an army to fight back by the chance when Lu garrison was not aware.
  But since then, the threat of war and death is hanging over the coast of the East Sea.

  This battle attracted all sorts of factions with each one's purpose. Maybe this war of restoration is simply the beginning of a series of chaos...
