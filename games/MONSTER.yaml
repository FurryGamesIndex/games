  Monster is a 2D fighting game released in 2005 and 2006 by 8105graphics. It features a diverse cast of human and anthropomorphic animal characters with a variety of unique fighting styles.
  
  Monster features a loose fighting system like other anime fighting games, but with a somewhat slower, more deliberate pace. It also features a Street Fighter Alpha 3 groove-style "shift" system, which allows the player to select one of three different modes to customize gameplay - Monster, Freedom, and Tranquility. Monster reduces attack speed but increases damage for a tankier gameplay style; freedom reduces damage and allows moves to be cancelled into each other for rushdown-oriented play; and tranquility emphasizes defense and improves moves' invincibility properties. When activated, these modes also change other special move properties to allow for further flexibility in gameplay styles.
  
  An arcade sequel was announced in 2008, to be published by Examu. It was quietly cancelled after location tests over a few years.
