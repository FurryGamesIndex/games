Furry Games Index is a young, open community project. We are committed to keeping FGI a non-profit project and always rooted in our community.

Our team is not large. Any help you can offer will be precious to us. If you are interested in contributing, there are three main ways to help us.

### Spread the word

We love furry fandom and hope to promote the development of furry culture. Creators are at the heart of this culture. That's what we're doing: bringing the work of game creators to a wider audience, which we hope that this will bring positive feedback to game creators. We also hope to make it easier for more furries to discover games. If you'd like to help us, please tell your friends about Furry Games Index.

### Suggest games for FGI / Point out errors or mistakes

Limited by team size and nature of our spare time, we may miss some great games or leave errors in some games or author entries. This is definitely not because we are biased against them. If you find us missing games or any errors, please contact us. We are open to requests for games of any sexual orientation.

If you would like to sign up for a GitHub account and open a discussion thread on this repository at Issues, that would be great, but reports via Email or Telegram are also very welcome.

### Direct participation in editing games and authors entries / Contributing Code

The final interface that FGI presents to the user is derived from processing the "FGI Game Database", "FGI Author Database", "FGI Tag Specifications", and other data files.

These data files are usually organized in a data serialization language called YAML, which is very easy to view and edit directly.

If you are interested, you can send edited YAML files directly to the FGI to add games/authors, fix errors in data files, etc. This is often a faster way to add games to the FGI database since it saves the maintainer or contributor time.

Our code base consists primarily of page rendering tools written in Python designed for FGI, and web interfaces written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript to present the end-user experience, as well as client-side logic such as search services and caching. If you have experience in any of these areas, you can send a Pull Request directly to this repository!

The maintainer can be contacted via Issues or other means to ask for clarification regarding the FGI codebase.
