# Furry Games Index

Welcome to Furry Games Index. A project devoted to collecting, organizing, categorizing, and labeling ***furry games***, as well as collecting links to their localization resources. Providing a convenient information retrieval service for ourselves and furry fandom.

The motive for creating this project was that Lucky Doge gave up his [Furry Game Collection](https://doge.im/recommend/kemono-games.html) project, and Utopic Panther once benefited from the project of Lucky Doge, and tried to rebuild a game collection on the Internet.
